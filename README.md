block2
======

The block2 code provides an efficient highly scalable
implementation of the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) for quantum chemistry,
based on Matrix Product Operator (MPO) formalism.

The block2 code is developed as an improved version of [StackBlock](https://sanshar.github.io/Block/),
where the low-level structure of the code has been completely rewritten.
The block2 code is developed and maintained in Garnet Chan group at Caltech.

You can find a bibtex file in `CITATIONS.bib`.

One can install ``block2`` using ``pip``:

* OpenMP-only version (no MPI dependence)

      pip install block2

* Hybrid openMP/MPI version (requiring openMPI 4.1.x)

      pip install block2-mpi

* Binary format is prepared via ``pip`` for python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11 with macOS (x86 and arm64, no-MPI) or Linux (no-MPI/openMPI). If these binaries have some problems, you can use the ``--no-binary`` option of ``pip`` to force building from source (for example, ``pip install block2 --no-binary block2``).

* One should only install one of ``block2`` and ``block2-mpi``. ``block2-mpi`` covers all features in ``block2``, but its dependence on mpi library can sometimes be difficult to deal with. Some guidance for resolving environment problems can be found in issue [#7](https://github.com/block-hczhai/block2-preview/issues/7) and [here](https://block2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/installation.html#installation-with-anaconda).

* To install the most recent development version, use:

      pip install block2==<version> --extra-index-url=https://block-hczhai.github.io/block2-preview/pypi/
      pip install block2-mpi==<version> --extra-index-url=https://block-hczhai.github.io/block2-preview/pypi/

  where ``<version>`` can be some development version number like ``0.5.2rc13``. To force reinstalling an updated version, you may consider ``pip`` options ``--upgrade --force-reinstall --no-deps --no-cache-dir``.

The detailed instructions on manual installation can be found [here](https://block2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/installation.html#manual-installation).

To run a DMRG calculation using the command line interface, please use the following command:

    block2main dmrg.conf > dmrg.out

where ``dmrg.conf`` is the ``StackBlock`` style input file and ``dmrg.out`` contains the outputs.
Example input files can be found [here](https://block2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/basic.html).

For DMRGSCF calculation, please have a look at [here](https://block2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/dmrg-scf.html).

StackBlock Compatibility
------------------------

A [StackBlock 1.5](https://github.com/sanshar/StackBlock) compatible user interface can be found at `pyblock2/driver/block2main`.
This script can work as a replacement of the StackBlock binary, with a few limitations and some extensions.
The format of the input file `dmrg.conf` is identical to that of StackBlock 1.5.
See `docs/driver.md` and `docs/source/user/basic.rst` for detailed documentations for this interface.
Examples using this interface can be found at `tests/driver`.

Instuctions for installing the StackBlock code can be found in [here](https://block2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/mps-io.html#stackblock-installation). A list of precompiled binaries of StackBlock can be found in [here](https://github.com/hczhai/StackBlock/releases/tag/v1.5.3).
